## Lecture style

The plan: Lectures and Labs will be in-class.

- I will sometimes just write on the board, so you should bring  
  a pencil and notebook (or equivalent technology) to the lecture.  
  - In these cases no content will be posted online.

- Sometimes I'll present information using slides, supplemented  
  with writing on the board.  
  - In these cases the slides will be posted after the lecture,  
    but not the board notes, so you should still make your own notes.

- For some course content I will post videos that can be watched  
  at your convenience.
