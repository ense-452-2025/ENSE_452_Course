## Intro to Embedded and Real-Time Systems

Why is taking an embedded real-time development course a desirable thing?

- You develop a skillset that straddles hardware and software — this can make you an extremely valuable employee.
- Embedded development is hard, and the skills it exercises can make you a more effective programmer in general.
- There are many billions of deployed microprocessor-based embedded systems.  
  Many of these have at least one real-time deadline.  
  You might just end up working in this area, but even if not, the *mindset* is justified and appropriate.

- Designing small embedded projects is fun!
  - It's *really* inexpensive to get into — there are tons of cheap micros, free development environments, and a large amount of online information.
  - Having a deep understanding from taking a class can give you an **order of magnitude boost**.
